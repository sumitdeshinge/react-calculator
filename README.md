# react-calculator

This is simple calculator using React.

Implementation Details:
The simple calculator is implemented using two methods:
1. Functional component
2. Class component
3. As of now for demo purpose I have kept both the implementations and rendered both UI components.

Supported functionality:
1. Addition / Subtraction / Multiplication / Division
2. Clearing of input expression or calculated result using Clear button
3. Deleting latest input using 'C' button. It clears recently entered input number or operator
4. Answer for input expression will be calculated using 'Result' button
5. Supports decimal numbers operations as well.

Future enhancements:
1. Currently input to the calculator is only through buttons on the UI which needs to be clicked using mouse. We can integrate keybaord relevants keys to operate the buttons from the calculator.
2. Buttons declaration can be optimized using array list.
3. CSS and styling
